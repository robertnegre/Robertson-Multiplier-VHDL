# Robertson Multiplication Algorithm in VHDL
## Computer Aided Design - Team Project
### Team Members: Robert Negre & Anca Ariesanu

**Requirement:** A simplified model of a multiplication algorithm in fixed point arithmetic. You will implement a known multiplication algorithn (Robertson). The model will have two components: a control unit (CU) and an execution unit (EU), each of them described behaviourally. EU performs all operations on the operands (right or left shift, addition, etc) and the CU gives the commands for the EU.
